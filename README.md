Project Description
- Our project is a backend API for managing chores in shared living spaces such as dorms, apartments, or houses. It is aimed towards college students that are adapting to new living arragmenets. Users will be able to form roommate groups which will have a shared list of chores. The API will support creating, updating, and completing chores. The goal is to reduce tension between roommates by making expectations clear and shared. All of the data will be stored in a relational database.
